# google-homepage
This is a project created for www.theodinproject.com. The assignment is to 
recreate the google homepage. 
Tools used:
Sublime, Chrome, Firefox, Git, Github, OpenOffice, Linux

I have limited experience with html and css. I first tried to do the job with 
tables but was not able to get the logo positioned easily. I abandoned that,
took a look at the google  page w/ dev tools and took a different approach. 
More tweaking could be done but I am moving on to the Difficult version of the
project.

update:
finish difficult version of assignment and returned to clean up this one.
